A guide to Deconstructor
	1. The Deconstructor uses data from DPD database, but not directly for a performance reason.
	2. Before use, the internal deconstructor table has to be created first by pressing the Generate button. This can take several minutes to process.
	3. Selecting higher maximum rows takes more time in retrieving data. But entering a more specific query can speed up the search considerably.
	4. There are three search modes or methods:
		i) Search from the beginning of head terms. This is normally quick for moderate maximum rows.
		ii) Search within head terms. This is also reasonably quick. This mode allows a query at least 2 characters long.
		iii) Search within both head terms and their deconstructions. This is quite slow, and Enter key or Search button has to be used to submit the query. This mode also allows a query at least 2 characters long.
	5. The result table can be clicked to see the row in detail.
