Notes on DPD dictionary
	1. This dictionary uses data from DPD database, but a new lookup table has to be created for better performance. Only some substantial information is selected to show here.
	2. Before use, the lookup table and other some have to be created first by pressing the Generate button. This can take several minutes to process.
	3. Selecting higher maximum results takes more time in retrieving data. But entering a more specific query can speed up the search considerably.
	4. There are two search modes or methods:
		i) Search from the beginning of head terms. This is normally quick for moderate maximum results.
		ii) Search within head terms. This is also reasonably quick. This mode allows a query at least 2 characters long.
	5. Results from deconstructor data can be included in the search by the hammer button provided. All the results will be merged and shown together.
	6. Some dictionary entries have further links to additional data, for example, information about roots. This can be seen as a small button with an arrow.
	7. When the table generation has been done, the Mini DPD in Dict module will be available. That can be more handy with a different search function but less informative.
