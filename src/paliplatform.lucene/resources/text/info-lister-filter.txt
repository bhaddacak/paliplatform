Term filtering guide
	1. There are four modes of term filtering: (1) Simple mode, (2) Wildcard mode, (3) Regular expression mode, and (4) Filter by meter. These can be selected by the option menu.
	2. In (default) Simple mode, only terms starting with the user's input text are shown. This mode, albeit simple, is case sensitive.
	3. In Wildcard mode, special characters, ? (any one letter) and * (any letters or none), are also allowed. For example, to see only terms having 2 letters, type ??; to see only term ending with 'o', type *o; to see terms having double c in them, type *cc*.
	4. In Regular expression mode, the user can enter regex pattern directly. For example, to see 'Atha', 'atho' or 'Attha', 'attho', type [Aa](t|tt)h[ao] or [Aa]t{1,2}[ao]. Keep in mind that complex patterns may give unexpected results.
	5. In Filter by meter, the user can find terms that match the input meter pattern. The valid input (case-sensitive) is, in any combination: 1, 2, 4, l, g, n, s, j, b, m, N, S, J, Y, B, R, T, M, and L. At syllable level, l (lahu) and g (garu) should be used, for example, llg can match 'bhagavā' but 112 can match both 'bhagavā' or 'bhagavati'. For more information, see Prosody window. 
	6. In addition, the retrieved records can be grouped by starting and/or ending characters. This can give a statistical insight. Moreover, it can be helpful to find peculiar terms that possibly come from editorial errors.
	7. In the grouping mentioned above, it operates on the retrieved records not directly from the database. So, the number of shown rows has to be chosen accordingly. Setting it to the maximum should cover the whole set of terms, but it takes time to process.
	8. In the result of grouping, a hyphen (-) includes zero or any number of characters. So, '-ti' means 'ti' itself and everything ending with 'ti'.
