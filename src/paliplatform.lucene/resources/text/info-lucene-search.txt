Lucene Finder's searching guide
	1. Wildcards available to use are ? (any one character), and * (any number of characters, including zero). These cannot be used in the first position, however.
	2. Multiple terms can be entered as the query. To be specific, these logical operation can be used (all caps): AND, OR, and NOT, for example, 'dhammo OR vinayo'. If none is used, AND is implied.
	3. Plus (+) and minus (-) mean 'include' and 'exclude' the term. The absence of both means optional. For example, '+dhammo -vinayo buddho' expects dhammo not vinayo; buddho is optional.
	4. To search an exact phrase, enter the query in double quotes.
	5. To search adjacent words, use double quotes with tilde (~). For example, "dhamma vinayo"~3 can search the two terms within 3 adjacent words apart.
	6. To enter a regular expression query, enclose it with a pair of slashes (/-/). For example, /dhamm[oā]/ can search either dhammo, or dhammā. In this mode, do not use a greedy pattern /dhamm.*/, but use /dhamm.*?/ instead.
	7. For more details of search syntax, see the user's manual.
