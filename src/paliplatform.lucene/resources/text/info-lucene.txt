A guide to indexing in Lucene Finder 
	1. Before searching, an index has to be built first by enabling "Indexing options". After a corpus and text group is selected and the Build button is pressed, the index will be created and available to select afterward.
	2. Some other options can also be set before the index is built:
		- Including numbers makes searching numbers in the text possible.
		- Normally, it is no need to include boldface text in the index, because the text itself is already a part of other fields. Only if the user really needs to search the boldface text, this option can be helpful.
		- Screening out short words, can reduce noise when searching. The options provide up to three characters long. For more than that, using stopwords is a typical practice.
		- The user can edit stopwords, by selecting the menu provided.
