A guide to batch transliteration
	1. Input files can be from different folders; the adding can be done several times.
	2. If not set otherwise, the output will be saved in the source directory.
	3. The input script can be either auto-detected or forced.
	4. File encoding has to be chosen properly. In Tipitaka-XML corpus, UTF-16 is used.
	5. The files can be in a structured format like XML. In case of Tipitaka-XML files, the XSL name will be changed correspondingly.
	6. The output will be always overwritten.
	7. There is an option to include or ignore Roman numbers in transliteration.
	8. For Roman output, different transliteration methods can be used:
	   - ISO 15919 is mostly used with Sanskrit (marked by ē, ō, ṁ, r̥, r̥̄, l̥, l̥̄).
	   - IAST uses ṃ, and the consonant ḻ (ḷ is a vowel).
	   - Pāli Common is like IAST except the consonant ḷ is used by familiarity.
	   - Least Contamination is like Pāli Common but symbols are retained visually (marked by ē = ai, ō = au, the consonant ḷ, the vowel ŀ).
	   - Roman Unique is like Least but the consonant ḻ and the vowel ḷ is used.
	9. When source text is Roman Sanskrit, the option 'Roman as Sanskrit' should be checked.
	10. If the conversion fails, try changing file encoding, and make sure that Sanskrit text is treated properly.
	11. Learn more by experimenting in the Text Editor with 'Load test data'.
