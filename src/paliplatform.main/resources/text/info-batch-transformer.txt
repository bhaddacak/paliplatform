A guide to batch transformation
	1. Input files can be from different folders; the adding can be done several times.
	2. By default, the input script is auto-detected; unknown scripts are not processed, but listed. If auto-detect option is disabled, the input script can be selected (only one per session).
	3. If not set otherwise, the output directory is the same as input's.
	4. If the output directory is the same as input's, the file name's suffix should be set.
	5. If output files already exist, transformation is not applied.
	6. If source and output script is identical, transformation is not applied.
	7. Roman script can be transformed to any of other scripts.
	8. Non-Roman scripts can only be transformed to Roman, otherwise transformation is not applied.
	9. The option of number inclusion works only for transformation from Roman to other scripts (except Sinhala).
	10. For Devanagari script, the transformation is least contaminated, for example, bars and double-bars are visually retained. For more information see help in the viewer of CST4 collection.
	11. Conversion from Myanmar script is not supported.
