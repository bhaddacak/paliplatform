CST4 data viewer guide
	1. The right pane shows the document's information, including related documents (if any).
	2. The document opened can be navigated by the left pane (if opened) with three criteria: by headings, by paragraph numbers, and by verses (only some part of the first line). 
	3. Related documents on the right pane can be opened independently without capability of synchronization. To use this feature, consider reading CST-restructured (CSTR) instead.
	4. The source was converted from Devanagari with least contamination. That is to say:
	   - Bars and double bars or daṇḍas (U0964 and U0965) are visually retained by converted to U007C, and U2016 respectively. No full stop period is ever used.
	   - The abbreviation sign (U0970) is visually retained by converted to U2024 (not a simple dot), and this is counted as part of the words. The dot itself (U002E) is only used with numbers.
	   - The rare Sanskrit vowel ai (U0910 and U0948) is converted to ē.
	   - The rare Sanskrit vowel au (U0914 and U094C) is converted to ō.
	   - The zero width joiner (U200D) is removed.
	   - No capitalized letters are used.
	   - Other Sanskrit and punctuation noises are removed.
	5. To convert a part of text to a familiar format, the user has to select a portion and open it in the Editor (or use the right-click after selecting). Then select "Reformat CST4 text" from Tools menu in the Editor.
