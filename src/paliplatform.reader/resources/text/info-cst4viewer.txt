CST4 data viewer guide
	1. This viewer is used with both CST Devanāgarī base and CST4 data.
	2. The right pane shows the document's information, including related documents (if any).
	3. The document opened can be navigated by the left pane (if opened) with three criteria: by headings, by paragraph numbers, and by verses (only some part of the first line). 
	4. Related documents on the right pane can be opened independently without capability of synchronization. To use this feature, consider reading CST-restructured (CSTR) instead.
	5. The CST4 data was converted from Devanāgarī with Least Contamination. That is to say:
	   - Bars and double bars or daṇḍas (U+0964 and U+0965) are visually retained by converted to U+007C, and U+2016 respectively. No full stop period is ever used.
	   - The abbreviation sign (U+0970) is visually retained by converted to middle dot (U+00B7), and this is counted as part of the words. The dot itself (U+002E) is only used with numbers.
	   - The rare Sanskrit vowel ai (U+0910 and U+0948) is converted to ē.
	   - The rare Sanskrit vowel au (U+0914 and U+094C) is converted to ō.
	   - The zero width joiner (U+200D) is removed.
	   - No capitalized letters are used.
	   - Other Sanskrit and punctuation noises are removed.
	6. To convert a part of CST4 text to a familiar format, the user has to select a portion and open it in the Editor (or use the right-click after selecting). Then select "Reformat CST4 text" from Tools menu in the Editor.
