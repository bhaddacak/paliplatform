Notes on CST XML data
	1. The fundamental XML files of the official CST corpus are in Devanagari script.
	2. You can select a text group to download by the option menu provided. By default, all the documents will be downloaded.
	3. Even though the downloaded files are kept in the cache, the files will always be downloaded to ensure the recency. So, the skip-download option is not available here.
