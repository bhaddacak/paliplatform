How to find a document
	1. There are roughly three modes of finding: (1) search in document's information as shown in TOC tree, (2) search in text references, and (3) search in document's contents (full text search).
	2. Documents' information is more than it is shown in the table. So, unexpected results often show up.
	3. Text references are abbreviations used for distinctive identifying a document. Here we can search their all possibilities including those used by academics. See also Reference Table for more details.
	4. In content search, a regular-expression pattern can be used as a search query. In this mode, all special characters are interpreted as regex meta-characters, and the user has to press Enter to submit the query. This search is case-sensitive, and at least three characters are allowed as a query. The last column of the result shows the number of instances found in each document.
	5. When a result of a content search is clicked, the matched words are showned in the status bar. When this document is opened, it will jump to the position of the first word found.
	6. To search a whole word in this mode, '\b' can be used to mark the word boundary, For example, "\bdhammā\b" matches "dhammā" not "xxxdhammāxxx". Remember that complex regex patterns take time to process.
	7. To narrow down the source and speed up the search, the inclusion of text groups should be set properly.
	8. The content search, despite its handiness, is brute, slow, and stupid. For a more refined search, consider using Lucene Finder.
