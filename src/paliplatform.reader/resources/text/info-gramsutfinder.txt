Notes on Grammatical Sutta Finder
	1. This tool has its web version at https://bhaddacak.github.io/gramsut.
	2. There are six books that have formula-like suttas, i.e., Kacc (k), Rūpa (r), Mogg (m), Payo (p), Niru (n), and Sadd (s).
	3. The cross-references are reconstructed from Niruttidīpanī without much checking. Sometimes they may be wrong, and sometimes they are overwhelming, but the information is worthwhile.
	4. Only Niruttidīpanī has notes in its suttas, disable these can reduce noise in the result.
	5. Search is done with simple string matching, but full text is searched (including notes), not just what you see. The cross-references can also be searched by entering the short form, e.g., k1 or m2.1 or s1105.
	6. Payogasiddhi already has sutta numbers related to Mogg, so it does not appear in the cross-references.
