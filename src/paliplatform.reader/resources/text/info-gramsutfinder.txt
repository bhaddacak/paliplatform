Notes on Grammatical Sutta Finder
	1. There are six books that have formula-like suttas, i.e., Kacc (k), Rūpa (r), Mogg (m), Payo (p), Niru (n), and Sadd-Sut (s).
	2. Cross-references are the relations between Kacc and Rūpa, and among Mogg, Payo (with new running numbers), and Niru.
	3. If Niru Xref option is enabled, cross-references suggested in Niruttidīpanī will be added to the entries of Niru.
	4. Only Niruttidīpanī has notes in its suttas, disable this option can reduce noise in the results.
	5. Search is done with simple string matching, but full text is searched (including notes), not just what you see. The cross-references can also be searched by entering the short form, e.g., k1 or m2.1 or s1105.
	6. When an item is clicked, its detail will show at the bottom. This always include the full information (Niru Xref + Notes).
	7. To include or exclude books, open the Book selectors with the button provided.
	8. Alternatively, to show only a book, you can enter the book's initial (cap) as a search query, i.e., K, R, M, P, N, and S.
