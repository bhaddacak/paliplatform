Notes on Pāli grammar books
	1. All grammar books have their web version in https://bhaddacak.github.io/grammarbooks, which are somewhat more handy to use.
	2. The text of Kaccāyana, Rūpasiddhi, Saddanīti Suttamālā, and Abhidhānappadīpikā are converted from Thai script available at 'Palipage' (https://sites.google.com/view/palipage).
	3. Other texts are taken from the Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana collection with rearrangement and some editing.
