Notes on text referencing
	1. Pāli text referencing is really a mess. Formerly we rely mostly on academic standard. Now this scheme is no longer adaquate. Because there is no unified method for now, I try my best to make the references more enjoyable to use and remember.
	2. The Academic method is shown for comparing. The sources of these references come from Oskar von Hinüber's "A Handbook of Pāli Literature" and "Standard Abbreviations of Pali texts" suggested by the Pali Text Society.
	3. The collection of PTS follows the PTS standard, whereas, if no better alternatives, the others follow my scheme (which borrows some ideas from the SuttaCentral).
	4. Items marked by an asterisk (*) have an additional note which can be shown by clicking them.

		Mv = Kd1 - Kd10
		Cv = Kd11 - Kd22
		D1 = DN1 - DN13
		D2 = DN14 - DN23
		D3 = DN24 - DN34
		M1 = MN1 - MN50
		M2 = MN51 - MN100
		M3 = MN101 - MN152
		S1 = SN1 - SN11
		S2 = SN12 - SN21
		S3 = SN22 - SN34
		S4 = SN35 - SN44
		S5 = SN45 - SN56
		Pt1 = Patthana1
		Pt2 = Patthana2
		Pt3 = Patthana3 - Patthana24
