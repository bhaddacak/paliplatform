Notes on Pāli Root Finder
	1. This tool has its web version at https://bhaddacak.github.io/paliroot, which is slightly handier and more powerful. Some other details can also be found in the web version.
	2. All roots known to us collected in four books are listed here.
	3. Pāli Dhātupāṭha are taken from the book by Dines Andersen and Helmer Smith (1921). This has no digital version.
	4. The large part of Dhātumañjūsā is taken from the Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana collection, but substantially edited against a Thai edition, which has variants marked as 'sy'.
	5. Saddanīti Dhātumālā also taken from the Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana with some editing and additions. Variants found in the Smith's edition (1929) and a Thai edition are marked as 'sm' and 'sy' respectively.
	6. Dhātvatthasaṅgaha is taken from Palipage then checked against a Thai edition, which has variants marked as 'sy'.
	7. Only Dhātupāṭha uses 9-group scheme, whereas the rest use 8-group. To differentiate the two, the former uses lowercase roman numbers but others use uppercases.
	8. Each column of the output table can be sorted by clicking the column header. So, roots that look similar can be grouped together by sorting the Root (second) column.
