Guide to Sanskrit Dictionaries
	1. Here is a collection of essential Sanskrit dictionaries. At this stage, only Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English dictionary is available for test.
	2. There are 3 modes of entering a query: (1) using composite characters, (2) using SLP1 transliteration, and (3) normal input (= using the system layout). The default selection can be set in Settings.
	3. The query can be of any script supported. To enter a non-Roman query, you have to use normal mode of input and a suitable pre-installed keyboard layout, for example, KaGaPa for Devanāgarī, and Zawgyi for Myanmar. Particularly for Devanāgarī, you can also use SLP1 mode.
