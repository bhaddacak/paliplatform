Guide to Sanskrit Dictionaries
	1. The query can be of any script supported. To enter a non-Roman query, you have to use normal mode of input and a suitable pre-installed keyboard layout. Particularly for Devanāgarī, you can also use SLP1 input mode.
	2. The available dictionaries are as follows:
	   - MW: Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary (1899)
	   - AP: Apte's Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary (revised, 1957)
	   - SHS: Jīvānanda Vidyāsāgara Bhaṭṭācāryya's Śabda-sāgara (1900)
	   - MD: Macdonell's Sanskrit-English Dictionary (1893)
	   - BHS: Edgerton's Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit Dictionary (1953)
	   - MWE: Monier-Williams's English-Sanskrit Dictionary (1851)
	   - AE: Apte's Student's English-Sanskrit Dictionary (1964)
	   - BOR: Borooah's English-Sanskrit Dictionary (1877-1881)
	3. When searching a Sanskrit word in meaning, only MW and BHS accept IAST. For the rest, you have to use SLP1 encoding (e.g. aMSa for aṃśa).
	4. See also the help in Pāli Dictionaries for the searching techniques.
