Guide to Sanskrit alphabet
	1. To see the classification of letters, you can select by a letter or a tag.
	2. The tags can also be changed to Roman Sanskrit or Devanāgarī by the button E/R/D.
	3. The classification mostly follows Madhav Deshpande's Saṃskṛtasubodhinī (A Sanskrit Primer).
	4. For Visarga, see also Arthur Macdonell's A Sanskrit Grammar for Students, I§6.
	5. For Roman transliteration, there are choices provided by Options button. The selection affects how, for example, ṛ, ḷ, ai, au, avagraha, daṇḍas, and abbreviation sign are rendered.
	6. You can open the typing test by the button given. This is useful when a non-Roman script is selected. The transliteration is done only from Roman to other scripts. If the result is not fully seen, try changing the font or maximizing the window.
